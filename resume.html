     MS Dhoni Biography: Birth, Age, Education, Cricket Career, World Cup, IPL, Records, Awards, Movies, Retirement and More
     
     Last week, South Africa celebrated the start of the SA20 competition with a lot of fanfare. Coach Stephen Fleming and other members of the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) coaching staff have ties to the Joburg Super Kings (JSK). Dhoni is unable to do this, though. As no Indian player is eligible to take part in the competition due to BCCI regulations, until and unless a player retires from Indian cricket, including the IPL.
     
     And Dhoni is still involved in the IPL despite his retirement from international cricket, so he cannot be associated with JSK in any capacity. Dhoni will be allowed to lead JSK on the day that he retires from the IPL. He will be able to practice his trade in SA20 as well.
